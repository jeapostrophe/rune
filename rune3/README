Architecture is similar to X11

Now that the basic architecture is in place...
+ Implement the layout engine interface
+ Implement the keymap interface
+ Implement the status bar
+ Implement the command line
+ Write some apps
+ Experiment with other viewers, like terminal and native text

ERRORS
- XXX The fonts look terrible again on my external display (it's not Retina)
- XXX There must be a better way!

---

Viewer
- Shows the screen
- Sends key-events and resize-events to Manager
- Reads screen state from Manager

Manager
- Manages the screen layout (like a window manager)
- Manages the active window (where key-events will be sent)
- Listens for some key-events to handle itself, others to send to active app
- Listens for changes from live windows
- Runs a mini-buffer at the bottom of the screen

Server
- Should there be something to intermediate between the Manager and the Apps?

Glossary:
- Screen: A 2D display of Unicode characters
- App: A program receiving events and display windows
** Should there be Apps without windows?
- Window: A 2D display of Unicode characters
++ Could be 'fixed width by App
++ Could be 'responsive to Manager's layout
- Live Window: A Window on the Screen
- Active Window: The window the user is interacting with
