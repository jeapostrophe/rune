Architecture is similar to X11

Viewer
- Shows the screen
- Sends key-events and resize-events to Manager
- Reads screen state from Manager

Manager
- Manages the screen layout (like a window manager)
- Manages the active window (where key-events will be sent)
- Listens for some key-events to handle itself, others to send to active app
- Listens for changes from live windows
- Runs a mini-buffer at the bottom of the screen

Server
- Should there be something to intermediate between the Manager and the Apps?

Glossary:
