** figure out a better pipeline between manager-process and editor-process
   https://github.com/shawnpresser/racket-unix-sockets
** repl: support input
   how to figure out when the sandbox wants to read?
** hirune-file should support controlling where focus goes
   For instance, a terminal should have the focused line at the
   bottom, but an editor should have the focused line in the middle.
** modal: command (minibuf) vs direct
   In command mode, you type in a little editor and send commands to
   the app under focus, or your command gets swallowed up by some
   other listener in between you and the app.

   In direct mode, every key-code, except like Esc, gets send to the
   same chain.

   Should apps signal that they are willing to do direct mode?

   Should hirune support different kinds of direct mode, like insert
   vs view?

** look at zenpen for style

** unified editor for many apps plus minibuf
   I'd like the editing framework to be a unified function/class so
   that the same keybinds and structures work in the minibuffer as
   well as various programs.
** command history/completion w/ context
   I'd like the command mode to keep a history that is sensitive to
   the active app AND the context. For instance, the history of what
   you did in this directory in the shell app.

   How do we make up & down do sensible things if you've done a lot of
   global commands lately?

   Completion with machine learning/stats/Bayes vs prefix?
** should minibuf submission only submit on "good" input?
   For instance, closed parens
** app: calculator
   no special features
** interesting hilighting idea: ids vs keywords
   https://medium.com/p/3a6db2743a1e/
   https://medium.com/programming-ideas-tutorial-and-experience/3a6db2743a1e
** code completion
   normally takes a part of the function and completes to entire
   function with a little bit of documentation at the same time. it
   would be interesting to embed searching the documentation into the
   editing experience so you can select the function based on a search
   of the documentation (rather than just the function name)

* Rune

Test Î»

Rune is an "operating system" and user interface. It performs the
jobs of:
- emacs
- screen
- xterm
- zsh
- conkeror
- irsii
- google-chrome
- xmonad
- xmobar
- dmenu
- miro
- workrave
- gmail
- google calendar
- newsblur
- twitter reader
- eog
- evince
- ps
- pkill
- crond

It is generalized over a user interface, so I can easily port it from
the console, framebuffer, X11, Wayland, etc. It is designed to have a
totally functional core so its state can be easily saved and reloaded
to exactly the same environment.

It has the concepts of a process, a Web view, a canvas, a buffer, a
frame, a window, and a file.

A lot of what it does is based on the concept of overlays... where a
specific chunk of space (characters or pixels) has added information
about it.

This information might affect rendering (color) or the behavior of
other commands (so that F1 could look at the 'help overlays of where
it is).

Modes would specify parsers and lexers that add overlay information to
the content they are reading (or to other content.) For instance, the
spell-check mode would add a 'spelled-wrong overlay given that
another mode had added the 'plain-text overlay. For instance, the
compile mode might look for messages of the form "file:line: message"
and add overlay to that file. For efficiency, we make the programmer
specify things about parser/lexer behavior, such that the entire file
doesn't need to be re-lexed.

Special Rune programs can produce pre-overlayed text.

Commands could search their body for overlays of a specific type
(such as "how many words are spelled wrong?")

* Layout Tree
  A view is a cursor plus a buffer---it represents an active buffer.

  A layout is n-ary tree where branches have "styles" and the leaves
  are views. Styles are stuff like: 
  - horizontal: Children are distributed equally horizontally
  - vertical: Children are distributed equally vertically
  - tall: One child is horizontal and the other children are
    vertical
  - mirror tall: One child is vertical and the other children are
    horizontal
  - full: One child has the whole space and the other children are
    hidden
  - header: There are exactly two children, one is on top and never
    receives focus
  - footer: There are exactly two children, one is on bottom and never
    receives focus
 
 [My Xmonad setup is (header "xmobar" (full (tall ...) (tall ...)
 ...)), whereas a normal emacs window is (footer (footer (view)
 mode-line) mini-buffer)]

 A focus is a zipper of a layout.

   - instant refresh

   try ideas as you think of them

   what about things that aren't animations? how do we turn arbitrary
   things into visualizations?
   - show the concrete values of identifiers in function
   - allow you to change those that are inputs
   - shows you the value of changes when the change happened (rather
     than the right being a store)
   - each iteration is shown as a different column. new lines are
     added at the beginning of loops to show the mentioned values that
     change that are used

   show the data, show the comparisons

   - gui manager (creating X/etc windows)

   Each "mode" would get its own process and send/receive messages
   about changes, overlays, etc

   Each "window" would get its own process and send/receive messages
   about cursor movement, key inputs, etc that may send it in turn
   to...

   Each "buffer" would get its own process to facilitate safe file
   modification
** TODO look at final term
   http://finalterm.org/
** TODO look at rings
   https://github.com/konr/rings
** TODO look at dbus and 9p
   The Plan 9 system is very interesting in its UNIX-ness. I like the
   idea of having each tool do a very specific and simple task. 

   For instance, the idea of in rune having each thing be either a
   file or a process is neat and could work...
   - the runefs would have files representing each of the buffers,
     and all of these would be backed on the filesystem, but only
     some of them would also be associated with named thing on the
     fs. When you turn on rune, you get its files and you could
     explicitly sync them to the OS with a save operation.

     file-load/os : path -> file-handle
     file-save/os! : file-handle path -> void

     file-rows : fh -> rows
     file-row : fh row -> string
     file-row-cols : fh row -> cols
     file-row-col : fh row col -> string

   - files that are opened by someone would have a zipper associated
     with them for random row/col modification, with the interface:

     file-insert-at! : fh row col char -> void
     file-delete-at! : fh row col -> void

   - each file would have an overlay database of rectangles with the
     interface

     rect = row X col X width X height

     file-overlay-ref : fh rect key -> val
     file-overlay-set! : fh rect key val -> void

   - processes could subscribe to events such as

     (on-file-change overlay-key overlay-value-pattern)


  concerns...
  - is row/col the best interface for the kind of text I deal with?
    racket source and org-mode are structured.
  - what if a file had an associated "structurer" where a structure's
    job is to produce a tree. A plain-text structure produces a list
    of lines, a programming language might produce a list of tokens
    or an ast-like thing

    How can you unify a text editor, a Web view, and the window manager?
    - The view is ultimately a bitmap -> eyes function.
    - If each thing can produce a bitmap, then they can be composed
      with a final call to the view.
    - More complicated: the view may push back down its width X height
    
    How can you unify window manager key events, application key
    events, minibuffer commands, and shell commands?
    - A single key evaluator loop can capture commands and dispatch
      them to the right place. This can be a nested process where some
      receivers accumulate results before dispatching themselves.

    How can you unify file buffers, Web sites, temporary content on
    the output of commands?
    - A virtual filesystem of byte content

    How can you unify the interface of, but separate the
    implementation of, a spell checker, a syntax highlighter, a
    compile error hightlighter?
    - Overlay "observers" as described above?

    How can you unify the implementation of a normal text editor, a
    Web browser, and a "live" text interface like org-mode, miro, mail
    reader, irc client, etc?
    - Emacs has complicated key handlers that look at their context
      and do stuff
    - You could attach overlay information that did the same thing as
      emacs

    A very different approach...
    - Make a gui system where you can create text windows (and it
      lays them out) and then listen for events, which could be keys
      or could be other events
    - The gui system would be in charge of laying out these windows
      (really it would just make one os window) and then listening for
      the input. 
    - some commands it would capture (like moving focus around) and
      others it would deliver to the application. commands like M-x
      might pop up a new view with handle for the original
      view/program (to sent it a message) commands like C-` would also
      get that handle, but would take it over and display on it.
    - in this world, a buffer is like a view to a program which
      interprets events its own way. each time you open a file, a new
      program would run (normally in the background) and stay running
      handling input to that file.
    - such programs would communicate with the os to arrange to only
      open them uniquely once and have them save their state so they
      could be restarted later
    - a single terminal session would be a program like this too
